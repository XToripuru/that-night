# That Night

Survival game that focuses on mechanics rather than graphics. The objective is to get as highest score as possible without dying to the zombies, in the game that becomes harder every second. To achieve that, you can use bombs, pistol and EMPs, but you need to remember to get food also. All these resources are renewable and can be found within chests that spawn randomly on the entire map. To make game more interesting you can pick various characters with each having their own modification to the gameplay, but you need to unlock them first through achievements.
